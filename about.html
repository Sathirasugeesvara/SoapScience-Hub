    <!-- PROJECT OVERVIEW -->
    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>SoapLab</strong> is an educational web-based project developed as part of the
            <strong>Applied Mathematics – Mathematical Modeling</strong> course.
            The project focuses on modeling chemical reactions involved in soap production
            and applying mathematical concepts to real-world chemical processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The website is designed to help students understand how chemical reactions,
            differential equations, and mathematical models are used in practical
            industrial applications such as soap manufacturing.
        </p>

    <!-- HOW THE PROJECT WORKS -->
    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>How the Project Works</h2>
        <p>
            The project is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific
            aspect of soap production and chemical modeling.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Theory</strong> section explains the basic concepts of soap,
            including its structure, types, and cleaning mechanism.
            The <strong>Chemical Reactions</strong> section introduces mathematical
            models of chemical reactions, including second-order reactions and
            radioactive decay, using differential equations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Calculator</strong> section allows users to input raw materials
            such as oils and alkali, and the system calculates the required quantities
            based on mathematical relationships.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- TECHNOLOGIES -->
    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML</strong> – Structure of the web pages</li>
            <li><strong>CSS</strong> – Styling and responsive design</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> – Interactivity and calculations</li>
            <li><strong>Mathematical Modeling</strong> – Differential equations and reaction models</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- DOCUMENTATION -->
    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Project Documentation</h2>
        <p>
            This project is based on official lecture materials provided for the
            Applied Mathematics course, including notes on modeling chemical reactions.
            The website serves as a digital representation of theoretical concepts
            combined with practical implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
            All calculations, models, and explanations follow standard academic
            references used in mathematical modeling and chemical engineering.
        </p>
