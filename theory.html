    <h1> Soap Theory </h1>
    <p>
        Soap is one of the oldest and most essential cleaning products in human history. 
        This page explains the chemistry, types, production methods, and scientific principles behind soap.

        <h2>What is Soap?</h2>
        <p>
            Soap is a chemical compound used for cleaning and personal hygiene. 
            Its molecules have a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and a hydrophobic (water-repelling) tail.
            This allows soap to remove grease and dirt effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            The hydrophobic tails attach to oils, while hydrophilic heads remain in water, forming micelles that trap dirt. 
            Soap has been used since ancient Babylon, Egypt, and Rome. Modern soaps may include fragrances, moisturizers, and antibacterial agents.

        <h2>Types of Soap</h2>
        <p>
            There are many types of soap depending on purpose and formulation:
        </p>
        <img src="images/types-of-soap.png" alt="Types of Soap">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bar Soap:</strong> Solid soap used for body and hands.</li>
            <li><strong>Liquid Soap:</strong> Convenient for hand washing; may include antibacterial agents.</li>
            <li><strong>Glycerin Soap:</strong> Transparent soap with glycerol for moisturizing.</li>
            <li><strong>Antibacterial Soap:</strong> Contains agents to reduce bacteria.</li>
            <li><strong>Specialty Soaps:</strong> Medicinal, organic, cosmetic soaps.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
        <h2>Saponification Reaction</h2>
        <p>
            Soap is made via the saponification reaction: triglycerides react with a strong alkali to produce soap and glycerol.
        </p>
        <img src="images/saponification.png" alt="Saponification Reaction Diagram">
        <p>
            Heat and controlled conditions are required. Different fats produce soaps with varying properties:
            coconut oil → rich lather, palm oil → hard bar. Glycerol may be left in soap or separated for other uses.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
        <h2>Scientific Importance</h2>
        <p>
            Soap production demonstrates applied chemistry and mathematical modeling. 
            Reaction kinetics help predict time, reactant amounts, and quality.
        </p>
        <img src="images/soap-production.png" alt="Industrial Soap Production">
        <p>
            Students can learn micelle formation, emulsification, and reaction optimization. 
            Soap making combines practical chemistry with scientific principles, making it both educational and essential.
