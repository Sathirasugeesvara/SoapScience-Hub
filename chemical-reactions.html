        <h2>Introduction to Chemical Reactions</h2>
        <p>
            A chemical reaction is a process of molecular rearrangement in which one or more substances,
            called <strong>reactants</strong>, are transformed into one or more new substances known as
            <strong>products</strong>. During this process, chemical bonds are broken and new bonds are formed.
        </p>
        <p>
            In applied mathematics, chemical reactions are studied using
            <strong>differential equations</strong> to describe how the concentrations of substances
            change over time.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Rate of a Chemical Reaction</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>rate of a chemical reaction</strong> refers to how fast the concentration of a
            reactant or product changes with respect to time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mathematically, reaction rates are often expressed as derivatives, such as:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>dx/dt</strong> – the rate of change of concentration with time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Differential equations allow us to predict the behavior of chemical systems and analyze
            their stability and long-term behavior.
        </p>

        <h2>Second Order Chemical Reactions</h2>
        <p>
            A second order chemical reaction involves the interaction (collision) of
            <strong>one molecule of substance A</strong> with
            <strong>one molecule of substance B</strong> to produce a new substance X.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reaction can be written as:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>A + B → X</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Let:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>a</strong> = initial concentration of A</li>
            <li><strong>b</strong> = initial concentration of B</li>
            <li><strong>x(t)</strong> = concentration of X at time t</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Then the concentrations of A and B at time t become:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Concentration of A = a − x(t)</li>
            <li>Concentration of B = b − x(t)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Differential Equation for the Reaction</h2>
        <p>
            The rate of formation of substance X is proportional to the product of the
            concentrations of A and B.
        </p>
        <p>
            This leads to the differential equation:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>dx/dt = λ (a − x)(b − x)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            where <strong>λ</strong> is a positive constant representing the reaction rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            This equation helps us find critical points, analyze stability, and solve
            the initial value problem to determine the concentration at any time t.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Special Case: Equal Initial Concentrations</h2>
        <p>
            If the initial concentrations of A and B are equal (a = b),
            the reaction simplifies significantly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The differential equation becomes:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>dx/dt = λ (a − x)²</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This form is easier to analyze and is commonly used in modeling
            symmetric chemical reactions.

        <h2>Radioactive Decay</h2>
        <p>
            Radioactive decay is another important example of a chemical process
            modeled using differential equations.
        </p>
        <p>
            In radioactive decay, a constant fraction of atoms decays per unit time.
            The rate of decay is proportional to the amount of material present.
        </p>
        <p>
            The governing differential equation is:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>dx/dt = −λx</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The negative sign indicates that the amount of radioactive material
            decreases over time.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>Radioactive Decay Law</h2>
        <p>
            Solving the decay equation gives the radioactive decay law:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>x(t) = x₀ e<sup>−λt</sup></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This equation is used in many real-world applications such as
            radiocarbon dating, nuclear physics, and medical imaging.
